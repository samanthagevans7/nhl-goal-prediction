# Predicting NHL Goal Probabilities with Machine Learning
this prject explores NHL shot data from [MoneyPuck.com](https://moneypuck.com) to build models that predict goal probabilities.
Starting with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression, the project progresses towards more advanced machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict whether a shot will be a goal using NHL shot data.  
- **Current Status:**  
  - Completed EDA on shot data.  
  - Built a baseline logistic regression model.  
  - Developed a refined logistic regression using feature selection.  
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Experiment with non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
  - Compare performance across models.  
  - Add feature importance visualizations and insights.

## Data

The data used in this project is from [MoneyPuck.com](https://moneypuck.com).
- Raw data files are not included in this due to size.
- Specific dataset: https://peter-tanner.com/moneypuck/downloads/shots_2024.zip
- Full data dictionary: https://peter-tanner.com/moneypuck/downloads/MoneyPuck_Shot_Data_Dictionary.csv

## Future Work
- Add non-linear models (Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  
- Visual dashboards or model comparison charts.  
- Summarize results in a blog/portfolio post.
